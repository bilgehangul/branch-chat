# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** A user must be able to branch off any paragraph into a focused child conversation and return to the exact spot in the parent — with a visible lead marker showing where they went and what they found.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Backend Proxy Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Backend Proxy Shell)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Plan 01-01 complete (backend scaffold + Wave 0 test stubs)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**By Phase:**

|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-backend-proxy-shell | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Provider abstraction interface must be designed in Phase 1 before any frontend pressure — design from UI feature needs (`chat()`, `findSources()`, `simplify()`), not from Gemini API shape
- [Init]: Flat normalized Zustand store (`Record<id, Thread>`, `Record<id, Message>`) must be locked in Phase 2 — no nested tree mutations
- [Init]: SSE streaming via `fetch` + `ReadableStream` only — `EventSource` cannot send auth headers
- [Init]: DOM pixel positions (gutter pill anchors) must never enter Zustand — track in component-local refs via ResizeObserver
- [01-01]: No type:module in backend/package.json — ts-jest uses CommonJS transform to avoid ESM/CJS conflicts
- [01-01]: @google/genai v1.x used (not @google/generative-ai which EOL'd Nov 2025)
- [01-01]: shared/types.ts at repo root so both backend and frontend can import without package boundary issues

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: ResizeObserver + React state update timing is highest-risk interaction — spike warranted before gutter positioning ships
- [Phase 5]: Annotation rendering must not break `data-paragraph-id` stability — validate before Phase 5 plans are finalized
